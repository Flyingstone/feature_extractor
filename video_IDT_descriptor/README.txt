How to use?

For Linux Users:

1. Install ffmpeg, openCV, and improved dense trajectory package (downloadable from http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/improved_trajectories).

You may encounter some problems during installation. Refer to 'install_linux_ffmpeg_OpenCV.pdf' and 'Prolems_when_installing_ffmpeg_OpenCV.pdf' for help.

2. Run $extract_Flickr_video_IDT.py to extract IDT descriptors.

Pay attention to the parameters L and W. The default value of L and W are 15 and 5, respectively. Modifying the value of L will change the length of descriptors.

For Windows Users:

1. Run demo.m to extract IDT descriptors. The package can be downloaded from http://xjpeng.weebly.com/publications.html
