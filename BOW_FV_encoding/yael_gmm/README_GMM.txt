Yeal_gmm v 1.0
--------------


Fast GMM fitting (diagonal covariances only) with Kmeans initialization and Fisher Vectors computation 
Based on the yael package

This toolbox can use BLAS/OpenMP API for faster computation on multi-cores processor.
It accepts dense inputs in single/double precision.

Installation
------------

Run "mexme_yael_gmm.m" to compile mex-files.

Testing
-------

Run "test_yeal_gmm.m" for demo
